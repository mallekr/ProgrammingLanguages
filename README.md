# Programming language
Code to start understanding creation of my own programming language.

## Lexer
The lexer tokenizes the input from the source code and is built to ignore comment code and assist in syntax analysis. The lexer passes
tokens to the parser.

## Parser
Part of the compiler front end along with the lexer. Parses source code to create new internal representation of the code and create a
syntax tree structure to pass to the evaluator.
